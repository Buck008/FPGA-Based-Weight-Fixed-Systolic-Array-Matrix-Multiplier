# FPGA-Based-Weight-Fixed-Systolic-Array-Matrix-Multiplier
This is part of my undergraduate graduation project, for a systolic array that computes matrix multiplication (the array size can be parameterized). You can run it on pynq z1. The repository contains the relevant verilog code, vivado configuration and C code for sdk testing.
